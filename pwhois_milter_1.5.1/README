The Prefix WhoIs Milter is a mail filter for Postfix and Sendmail.  It queries
Prefix WhoIs (whois.pwhois.org by default) about the originating IP address
found in the final Received or X-Originating-IP mail header.  The information
that it returns may be used for greylisting and can be displayed in modern
e-mail clients to provide some background as to the origin of the message.

The Prefix WhoIs milter appends e-mail headers of the form X-PWhois-Field-Name
corresponding to a field in the response from Prefix WhoIs.  Currently, it
inserts information from the Origin-AS, AS-Org-Name, Org-Name, Net-Name, Region,
Country and Country-Code Prefix WhoIs response fields.

The PWhoIs Milter turns boring e-mail headers like this:

To: "You" <you@example.com>
From: "John Doe" <johndoe@example.com>

... and appends useful metadata from query results, like this:

X-PWhois-Origin: 4.2.2.1
X-PWhois-Origin-AS: 3356
X-PWhois-AS-Org-Name: Level 3 Communications
X-PWhois-Org-Name: Level 3 Communications, Inc.
X-PWhois-Net-Name: LVLT-ORG-4-8
X-PWhois-City: BROOMFIELD
X-PWhois-Region: COLORADO
X-PWhois-Country: UNITED STATES
X-PWhois-Country-Code: US

The Prefix WhoIs milter implements a safety timeout in case of a network or
Prefix WhoIs outage; if the timeout period elapses, the message passes through
unaltered and without further delay, so it is safe to run even in high-volume
e-mail environments.


Installation Instructions

Libmilter is required to build pwhois_milter.  This is often available in
package repositories, such as libmilter-dev for Debian, or you may wish to use
libmilter from the Sendmail source distribution.  Then, simply issue

# make && make install

and copy the init script corresponding to your system to the proper location.


Usage Hints and Tips

Add to your Postfix main.cf smtpd_milters chain:

inet:localhost:8472

If you have existing milters in your Postfix milter chain, separate them with a
comma or space.  Neither Postfix nor Sendmail will start pwhois_milter for you
so you must run the appropriate init script for your system.  Alternatively, you
may wish to run the milter manually:

pwhois_milter -i /path/to/pidfile.pid -l /path/to/logfile.log [ -u UID -g GID ]

View further command line options by running pwhois_milter with no parameters.

Although pwhois_milter has not been tested with Sendmail, it ought to work if
you add the following to your sendmail.mc:

INPUT_MAIL_FILTER(`PWhois Milter', `S=inet:8472@localhost, T=E:10s')

Signal pwhois_milter with SIGUSR1 to reopen the log file for rotating logs.
(SIGHUP will terminate the milter.)  Preferably configure logrotate(8) or
touch(1) the log file to create it before instructing pwhois_milter to use it.
It may not be able to create the file on its own, in case it runs with limited
privileges, if the log path permissions would deny it creating a new file.
