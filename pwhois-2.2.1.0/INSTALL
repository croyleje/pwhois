pwhoisd (the service daemon part of the system) is written in C and
the loader script (pwhois-updatedb) is written in PERL and requires a
new PERL system (5.6 or later, however 5.8.X is preferrable).

It also requires MySQL (we recommend 5.6)
The DBD::mysql modules and libmysqlclient is required.

Several other PERL modules are also required.  See install.sh

To install, enter './install.sh' (as root) on the command-line and
the installation should commence. It will ask various questions
and isn't very robust, but may assist in the process of the install.
There are very few components.  Should you wish to install manually,
it shouldn't be difficult.

The primary steps are:

1. Create the User/Group for the pwhoisd process to run as
2. Install the binaries into their permanent locations we like /usr/sbin
        or /usr/local/sbin
3. Setup the init script if warranted (see  the contrib/init directory)
4. Create the database, user/password and import the tables. (See the
        mysql/ directory for scripts to create these
        tables and the SQL commands.
5. Setup the cron entry to execute the pwhois-updatedb command at a defined
        interval.  A sample crontab file is provided as an example of what we run.
6. Edit the pwhoisd.conf configuration file, usually placed in
        /etc/pwhois/pwhoisd.conf
6a. Import your first set of data using the pwhois-updatedb command
6b. If using ARIN database for WHOIS resolution, download the data from ARIN using the
 pwhois-arin-snapshot-load script.  You will need to have an account with ARIN to do this. 
 (sorry, we can't give you access to do that ourselves). see: http://www.arin.net
6c. If using a GEO database, download feed of data and use geo-update.sql 
(you will have to modify to point it at the location of your CSV file, and may have to modify the structure of the table accordingly),
to load the data.  

7. Start the pwhoisd server process

You are now ready to connect to your server and try it out.

        $ whois -h localhost <ip>
