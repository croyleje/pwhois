Here is a list of servers which support the "Cisco" style output ("pretty printed routing table"), for which pwhois-updatedb can parse
directly over a telnet connection to that router/routeview server.

This list mostly is taken from the Route Views Project page available at:

	http://www.routeviews.org/

Thanks to the fine people that run the University of Oregon Route Views Project, this is all possible.


Server/IP				Port  System	Type/Routes			   Location
route-views.routeviews.org		23    Zebra	IPv4 uni/multi-cast multihop	   U of Oregon, (Eugene OR, USA)
route-views2.routeviews.org		23    Zebra	IPv4 uni/multi-cast multihop	   U of Oregon, (Eugene OR, USA)
route-views.eqix.routeviews.org		23    Zebra 	IPv4/v6	(Only IPv4 are parseable)  Equinox, (Ashburn, VA, USA)
route-views.isc.routeviews.org		23    Zebra 	IPv4 uni/multi-cast		   ISC (PAIX), (Palo Alto, CA, USA)
route-views.linx.routeviews.org		23    Zebra 	IPv4/v6 uni/multi-cast		   LINX, (London, GB)
route-views.wide.routeviews.org		23    Zebra	IPv4/v6 uni/multi-cast		   DIXIE (NSPIXP), (Tokyo, JP)


You might also try to download the BGP routing table (cisco "show ip bgp" format), from a mirror or archive server 
and load into the database using the command:

	pwhois-updatedb -r <id_of_router> -i <filename>

In the future PWHOIS may be able to read the MTR format or other formats (Juniper).

The Route Views Project also maintains archives of all the data and makes it available at:

	http://archive.routeviews.org/oix-route-views/

Ex. (see contrib/doloop/pwhois-snapshot-reload)

	#!/bin/sh
	ROUTER_ID=128.223.60.103
	YEAR=`date "+%Y"`
	MONTH=`date "+%m"`
	
	if [ -f /var/pwhois/oix-full-snapshot-latest.dat ]; then
		rm /var/pwhois/oix-full-snapshot-latest.dat;
	fi
	
	cd /var/pwhois
	wget http://archive.routeviews.org/oix-route-views/$YEAR.$MONTH/oix-full-snapshot-latest.dat.bz2
	bunzip2 /var/pwhois/oix-full-snapshot-latest.dat.bz2
	/usr/sbin/pwhois-updatedb -i /var/pwhois/oix-full-snapshot-latest.dat -r $ROUTER_ID -v -l /var/log/pwhois-updatedb.log
	rm /var/pwhois/oix-full-snapshot-latest.dat
