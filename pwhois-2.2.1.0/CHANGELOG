# PWHOIS Revision History
##################################################

2.2.1.0:

Added routeview transit-as query type.

2.2.0.0:

Decoupled pwhoisd from the database and now it relies solely on binary cache
files that it loads into memory to satisfy queries.  More data is available for
standard queries qualified with type=all.  See the help text for new queries;
netblock queries by net-name and net-handle have been dropped.  Corrected
multiplier for 32-bit ASNs: users should update ASNs in any existing bgp_routes
table before upgrading by using mysql/updateasns.sql.  Added a CIDR field to the
ACL table to accommodate network blocks.  Apply this change to existing ACL
tables using mysql/updatepwhoisacl.sql.  Bugfixes for ACL and accept() failure.
Added a CSV logging option (-R,--report) and Country-Code field in standard
whois output.  The version command now reports the correct server start date.

2.1.0.0:

Migrated to MySQL.

2.0.21.56:

Changes in the output of the CYMRU (Column) format (type=cymru 4.2.2.1) 
to include the Org-Name and Net-Name values.  The AS-Org-Name was already 
being shown buthis is now explicitly labelled AS ORG NAME in the header 
to make the distiction.

Added syslog logging to LOCAL1 facility to allow log files to be more 
easily rotated without requiring a restart. To activate syslog support,
use the 'pwhoisd.logfile=syslog' configuration attribute in pwhois.conf


2.0.21.55:

Problem with RIPE and other RPSL(2) formats was found.  pwhois-updatedb 
incorrectly choose a nethandle value which was not unique enough given 
the data.  This routine now creates a more unique nethandle by 
combining the starting IP with the CIDR value for the ending range IP 
in a textual format.  The purpose of the nethandle is only to be consistent 
with the ARIN data format, where the user creates a netblock record within 
their system and when this happens, it creates a unique nethandle value.  
In the RPSL format, there is no such value (and unique ID other than the 
prefix range values themselves).

To correct your existing data, please uses the 
postgresql/fix_nethandles.pl script before your next load of RPSL 
formatted data.  this will automatically update records in your database 
that are marked as source > 1 (not ARIN).  This will take some time to 
execute though, so please be patient.  Then of course restart your 
PwhoisD after doing this.

-- 

Introduced is the Fast Load feature.  PwhoisD now in fastload mode 
(see pwhoisd.conf) will read database extract files in a standard 
location (usually /var/pwhois) and will load the data tree without the 
complex database interation and reorganization.  Use the preppwdump 
utility to extract data from the database and generate this files.
 
pwhoisd will reload the data in memory from these files on a SIGHUP.  
The major benfit here is pwhoisd can stay online serving clients during 
the reload process, since reloading can be done offline now causing a 
very small outgage only while it reloads the data -- a few seconds, not 
many minutes or even hours.

There is a script in contrib/fastload.sh that you can use to 
automatically download new pwdumps and then signal pwhoisd when they are 
done/complete.


2.0.20.54:  Added a version number check/startup routine to read the 
pwhois.db entry in the version table so decisions can be made about how 
to execute queries, for backward compatibility.  Changed the loadArin 
routine to use a new column in the database which is the enetrange field.  
This change causes a DDL change and now there are two versions of this 
routine to load the database in different ways based upon version or now 
version 4 of the database model.  Added a v3tov4.sql upgrade script to 
help users convert between verson 3 and version 4 of the database model 
see postgresql/updatedbv3tov4.sql script for more details.  This version 
also cleans up a few minor logging things as well as fixes a synch bug 
related to the use of inet_ntoa.

2.0.20.53:  Changed the memory allocator to display allocated memory in 
the type=all statistics output to help diagnose a crash issue and see memory 
consumption

Also, pwhois-updatedb was changed to support the RPSL(2) formats.  Also 
the MRT formated dump files from quagga/zebra BGP route servers can be 
imported.

2.0.19: changed pwhois_thread to work around a Linux specific socket 
timeout option

2.0.18:

2.0.17: Updated the socket timeout to 10 seconds (from 1 second) for 
longer lived requests.  Problems with whob -a was causing disconnections 
sometimes.

2.0.16: Updated Regex parsing code to allow app= tags for backward 
compatibility with whob 2.0, which sends the app= tag when using the -a option

2.0.15: Added a type=all option for registry queries which will display 
a short version of the POC handle information inline with the other 
registry information.  This makes our output more conformant with other 
WHOIS servers and avoids additional calls to the server when the user 
is looking for the POC's contact information.  This may become the default 
option at some point and may have to specify via 'type=minimal' or 
something like that to not get the POC handle's contact info.  This 
costs 4 extra database queries to get the info inline.  

2.0.14: Rewrite of pwhoisd in C.  Removal of the ACL restrictions of on 
advanced queries,  See "help" command.
  Implementation of GEO resolution.  Some additional scripts in contrib 
directory for managing public global PWHOIS servers.
  
1.5.1: It was determined that PWHOIS was incorectly (or imprecisely) 
returning the Origin-AS's ORG-NAME  regardless if that network's ORG-NAME 
was, based upon the associated of the Org-Name and Org-ID through the 
Netblock, not through the AS who is announcing the block.  This happens 
when a block is swip'd to annother org, but the organization does not 
announce their block directly.  The existing AS announced Org-Name is 
returned in a new AS-Org-Name field, and the swiped Org-Name or whatever 
is available through the Org-ID reference this is returned now in the 
existing and current Org-Name field.  THIS COULD BREAK YOUR APPLICATION, 
if you were expecting the AS-specific Org-Name in the Org-Name field.  
Please use the AS-Org-Name field now for this purpose.

If you have any questions about this, please email as at pwhois-team@pwhois.org

1.5.0: Added support for WHOIS data via ARIN data extract

With support from ARIN, for research purposes only, the PWHOIS project
was able to receive an extract of the ARIN WHOIS database for inclusion in
limited and regulated quantities along side prefix-based whois information (
when served by our global PWHOIS servers).  

	whois -h whois.pwhois.org  <IP>

We've agreed to only provide this information for research purposes and must
limit access to the system from automated software programs, etc. to prevent
harvesting.  For this reason the WHOIS database itself is not included in the
open-source archives or extracts, and if you wish to run your own copy of the
PWHOIS server with this WHOIS data available, you must request access to it 
directlyfrom ARIN, and we can not be liable for any mishandling or misuse of 
this information
under your control.

Once you've received access, see the pwhois-updatedb --import-whois-dump 
command-lineoption for instructions on how to import the data into the database.
Some changes to the database were required to store this information and make 
it available to the PWHOIS server.

The standard queries, ex.  './pwhois 4.2.2.1' will now return the Net-Name, and
Org-Name (if available).  Since we now have this data, many of the other formats
(cymru, rpsl, and pwhois) were changed to be more compatible with the original 
servicesand cymru (for example) should now be identical to the Cymru format 
available from whois.cymru.com, especially when used in bulk mode.

The WhoB client library and LFT have been concurrently revised to take advantage 
of this newfeature.  These applications are released separate from the same 
website.

Upgrading from 1.0.X:

The database schema changed between versions 1.0.X and 1.1.  To support this 
change,we recommend you simply drop your pwhois database (using the database 
specific commands you might use), and then import the new database schema using 
the install script (install.sh), or manually (see the mysql or postgresql 
directories in the distribution).


1.0.4: Modified some advanced features to required access in the ACL table

To support the 1.4 release of LFT, which has the ability to query for
some of the advanced (but still experiemental) features of PWHOIS, we have
decided to make the advanced features require access, so we can prevent
performance degradation of the regular prefix-based queries until we can
rewrite the server so these requests are non-blocking.

If you have a legitimate need to use these features, we suggest you setup
your own PWHOIS server and query against that to your hearts content.  Just
add your source IP address to the ACL table with a value of 2 or higher. 

1.0.3: More bug fixes

Improved the statistics output via the 'version' command.

Improved updatedb program so that it can properly read wrapped "show ip bgp" 
formattedfiles that are downloaded via the --display-only or from a archive 
server, and areread in via the -i option.

Cleaned up documentation, updated the programs to select the specific fields 
insteadof using a SELECT * for some of the queries, and added a small script 
pwhois-getarchive.shto download an archive of the "show ip bgp" output from 
the routeviews.org archive server.  See servers.list for more details. 

1.0.2: More Bug fixes

Cleaned up common code that was duplicated in multiple places in pwhoisd.  
Cleanedup help documentation.  Changed the pwhois and pwhois-updatedb process 
to properlyhandle the router_id field in the database and still function 
properly when loading data from more than one datasource.  Added option for 
the configuration file,

pwhois.router-id=<IP> so the server can provide a view of the data for the
Forwarding Information Base (FIB), instead of getting confused and having the last
records loaded win.

pwhois-updatedb now has a --routerid option to support telling the process what the
router-id should be when loading from a file, where it would have no idea.  It use to
use the value of zero, and still will if you don't specify.  This is fine if you only
have one data source, but isn't fine when you have more than one.

1.0.1: Bug fixes

Changed the pwhois-updatedb process to make it more robust in handling different
prompts and data that come back from the route servers.  It still has a ways to
go, but should work properly in most cases.  Fixed problem in previous version
which caused extra DNS lookups to occur inside the parse update code.

Also fixed minor problem when an IP isn't in the FIB, pwhoisd would display the
time in the output string of the request from the client versus showing the time
the data was last updated.

1.0.0:  First major release

Supports the basic functionality and features to search for the most specific
origin-AS given an IP address and a snapshot of the global internet routing table,
which is usually only (up to) 4 hours old.  Supports pwhois, Cymru and RPSL
output formats as well as bulk input/output.

Has a basic access control list mechanism to limit queries by IP address,
should someone be abusing the service.
