DESCRIPTION
     The Internet is a large and complex aggregation of network hardware, con-
     nected together by gateways.  Tracking the route one's packets follow (or
     finding the miscreant gateway that's discarding your packets) can be dif-
     ficult.  (from traceroute(8))

     lft sends various layer-4 probes (differing from Van Jacobson's UDP-cen-
     tric method) utilizing the IP protocol `time to live' field and attempts
     to elicit an ICMP TIME_EXCEEDED (during transit) response from each gate-
     way along the path to some host.  lft also listens for various TCP and
     ICMP messages along the way to assist network managers in ascertaining
     per-protocol heuristic routing information and can optionally retrieve
     various information about the networks it traverses.

     The only mandatory parameter is the target host name or IP number.
     Options toggle the display of more interesting data or change the vari-
     ables of the trace itself.  The (-E/-e) adaptive option tries several
     combinations of TCP states (changing flags inside the probes it sends) in
     order to improve the chances of a successful trace and expose stateful
     packet filters.

     Other options are:

     -d dport
	     Set dport as the destination TCP port of the probes LFT gener-
	     ates.  Default is 80.  This option is useful to see if packets
	     follow a different route based on protocol destination, a likely
	     scenario when load balancers or proxies are involved.  This
	     option may also bypass less sophisticated packet filter configu-
	     rations.

     -s sport
	     Set sport as the origin TCP port of the probes LFT generates.
	     Default is 53.  This option is useful to see if packets follow a
	     different route based on protocol source. This option may also
	     bypass less sophisticated packet filter configurations.

     -z      Automatically select a pseudo-random source port.	This option
	     may be useful if your local packet filter or proxy doesn't allow
	     you to use source ports outside of the dymanic range allocation.

     -m min  Set min as the minimum number of probes to send per host.
	     Default is 1 unless adaptive (-E) mode is used.

     -M max  Set max as the maximum number of probes to send per host.
	     Default is 5.

     -a ahead
	     play).  Default is 1.

     -q ISN  Set ISN as the ISN (initial sequence number) of the first probe.
	     If unset, one will be automatically generated using a pseudo-ran-
	     dom, time-seeded algorithm.

     -D device
	     Set device as the network device or IP address to be used.
	     (e.g., "en1" or "1.2.3.4")  If unset, lft will attempt to deter-
	     mine and acquire the appropriate interface based on routing.

     -H ttl  Set ttl as the maximum TTL, essentially the maximum route traver-
	     sal distance in hops.  Default is 30.

     -I      Set the ToS (Type of Serice) bit on outgoing IP datagrams.  The
	     ToS will be set to the differentiated services request minimize-
	     delay.

     -i      Disable "stop" on ICMP other than TTL expired.

     -n      Print addresses numerically rather than symbolically and numeri-
	     cally.  Disables use of the DNS resolver completely.

     -h      Print addresses symbolically rather than symbolically and numeri-
	     cally.  If the DNS resolver fails to resolve an address, the
	     address is printed numerically.

     -E/e    Enable use of the adaptive engine which tries several combina-
	     tions of TCP states (changing flags inside the probes it sends)
	     in order to improve the chances of a successful trace.  The
	     engine also displays other useful information such as stateful
	     inspection firewalls or broken IP stacks encountered along the
	     way.

     -F      Enable use of TCP packets with the FIN flag set.  This strategy
	     fools unsophisticated packet filters that don't maintain a proper
	     state table.  Such devices will forward the packet to its desti-
	     nation rather than filter it, assuming a handshake has already
	     taken place and the probes are part of an existing and valid TCP
	     stream.

     -u      Enable use of UDP-based probes instead of TCP-based probes.  This
	     strategy is similar to the traditional traceroute method, but
	     many of LFT's other options (such as source and destination port
	     selection) are still available.  By default, LFT's UDP probes
	     have a small payload (unlike LFT's TCP probes that carry no pay-
	     load) and contain proper UDP checksums.

     -N      Enable lookup and display of network or AS names (e.g., [GNTY-
	     NETBLK-4]).  This option queries Prefix WhoIs, RIPE NCC, or the
	     RADB (as requested).  In the case of Prefix WhoIs or RADB, the
	     network name is displayed.  In the case of RIPE NCC, the AS name
	     perspectives.  See www.ripe.net/projects/ris

     -C      Force use of the Cymru whois service to lookup ASNs.  This is an
	     alternative source of timely ASN-related information built using
	     the Internet's global routing table and multiple Tier-1 ISP per-
	     spectives.  See www.cymru.com

     -R      Force use of the RADB whois service to lookup ASNs.  This tends
	     to be quick, but incomplete and usually inaccurate with regard to
	     the 'actual' Internet routing table.  See www.radb.net

     -T      Enable display of LFT's execution timer.  This option places
	     timers on the trace itself and on lookups and name resolution to
	     show where LFT is spending its time, waiting on resolvers, or
	     processing trace packets.	Use with -V (verbose) to display addi-
	     tional detail.

     -U      Display all times in UTC/GMT0.  This option also enables the -T
	     option automatically.

     -S      Suppress display of the real-time status bar.  This option makes
	     LFT show its completed trace output only, no-frills.

     -V      Display verbose output.  Use more V's for more info.

     -v      Display version information, then exit(1).

     Any hosts listed after these options and before the final host/target
     will comprise the loose source route.  Since network operators have secu-
     rity concerns regarding the use of source routing, don't expect the LSRR
     options to do anything for you in most public networks.


EXAMPLES
     A sample use and output might be:

     [edge.lax]$ lft -S 4.2.2.2

     Hop  LFT trace to vnsc-bak.sys.gtei.net (4.2.2.2):80/tcp
      1   ln-gateway.centergate.com (206.117.161.1) 0.5ms

     21   [target] vnsc-bak.sys.gtei.net (4.2.2.2) 11.2ms


     Now, using the adaptive engine option:


     [edge.lax]$ lft -E -S 4.2.2.1

     Hop  LFT trace to vnsc-pri.sys.gtei.net (4.2.2.1):80/tcp
      1   ln-gateway.centergate.com (206.117.161.1) 0.5/0.5ms
      2   isi-acg.ln.net (130.152.136.1) 2.1/2.3ms
      3   isi-1-lngw2-atm.ln.net (130.152.180.21) 2.6/7.1ms
      4   gigabitethernet5-0.lsanca1-cr3.bbnplanet.net (4.24.4.249) 6.1/3.9ms
     **   [firewall] the next gateway may statefully inspect packets
      5   p0-0-0.lsanca1-csr1.bbnplanet.net (4.24.4.10) 155.4/3.7ms
      6   [target] vnsc-pri.sys.gtei.net (4.2.2.1) 22.6/3.7/*/*/*/*/*ms


     In the scenario above, the adaptive engine was able to identify a state-
     ful, packet-inspecting firewall in the path.  Another example with more
     options:


     [edge.lax]$ lft -S -A -T -m 2 -d 80 -s 53 www.yahoo.com

     Hop  LFT trace to w9.scd.yahoo.com (66.218.71.88):80/tcp
      1   [226] ln-gateway.centergate.com (206.117.161.1)  1 ms
      2   [226] isi-acg.ln.net (130.152.136.1)	2 ms
      3   [226] isi-1-lngw2-atm.ln.net (130.152.180.21)  3 ms

      5   [1] p6-0.lsanca1-cr6.bbnplanet.net (4.24.4.2)  5 ms
      6   [1] p6-0.lsanca2-br1.bbnplanet.net (4.24.5.49)  3 ms
      7   [1] p1-0.lsanca2-cr2.bbnplanet.net (4.25.112.1)  3 ms
      8   [16852] pos4-0.core1.LosAngeles1.Level3.net (209.0.227.57)  3 ms
      9   [3356] so-4-0-0.mp1.LosAngeles1.Level3.net (209.247.10.193)  3 ms
     10   [3356] so-3-0-0.mp2.SanJose1.Level3.net (64.159.1.130)  11 ms
     11   [3356] gige10-0.ipcolo4.SanJose1.Level3.net (64.159.2.42)  11 ms
     12   [3356] cust-int.level3.net (64.152.81.62)  52 ms
     13   [10310] vl17.bas2.scd.yahoo.com (66.218.64.150)  53 ms
     14   [10310] w9.scd.yahoo.com (66.218.71.88) [target]  54 ms

     LFT's trace took 5.23 seconds.  Resolution required 3.58 seconds.


     Note the -Ar above displays ASNs using the RADB as a whois source.  A
     better option may have been to use the -A alone or perhaps -AC.

     And why not request netblock lookups?


     [edge.lax]$ lft -S -N www.microsoft.com

     Hop  LFT trace to www.us.microsoft.com (207.46.197.113):80/tcp
      1   [LOS-NETTOS-BLK4] ln-gateway.centergate.com (206.117.161.1)  2 ms

HISTORY
     The lft command first appeared in 1998 as 'fft'.  Renamed as a result of
     confusion with fast fourier transforms, lft stands for 'layer four
     traceroute.'
